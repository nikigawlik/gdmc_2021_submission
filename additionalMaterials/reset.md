here are some limitations

- i want to work with textures (2d)
- i still want verticality tho
- agent pathfinding is cool

i have

- a building generator (flat)
- some box experiments (javascript)
- a WFC implementation
- image processing knowledge

and ideas on

- agent based pathfinding


big picture algorithm:

- starts at 500,500
- traveling agents algorithm -> find a good spot
- identifies key environment features
  - highest spot(s)
  - lowest spot(s)
  - water source(s)
  - lava source(s)
  - trees
  - building materials
- construct information maps
  - heightmaps -> base level maps
  - surface maps -> buildability maps
- generate 'buidlings'
- generate 'floors'
- generate 'rooms' within floors
- => extract rooms with maximum connectivity graph
- 2d image representation of the mcg
  - portals!
- run ant colony simulation
- asign areas, place clutter and stuff

- generate chronicle from logs



Evaluation
- Adaptation to Environment and Terrain
  - availablre resources
  - elevation
  - irrigation
  - temperature
- Functionality from an Embodied Perspective
  - accesability and mobility
  - navigation
  - darkness / mob spawns
  - food
- Believable and Evocative Narrative
  - Reflective of class, hyper-capitalist ideology and it's results
  - High Tech, Low Life
  - State of Decay
  - Layers over Layers
- Visual Aesthetics
  - Interesting color palette
  - aesthetics of light and dark
  - silhuettes
  - postitive and negative space
  - decoration and clutter
