outlmap -> general graph -> cycles

outlmap -> walker 

- for pixel in allpixels:
  - is pixel == 1?
    - mark this pixel as 2
    - repeat
      - add position to list (specify if corner?)
      - walk to neighboring pixel (that is 1 or 2)
        - if pixel is 2:
          - save list as loop
          - exit repeat loop
        - if pixel is 1
          - set self to 0
